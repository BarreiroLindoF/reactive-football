# Reactive-Football

This is a small project for a school source on advanced javascript libraries.

## Description

We had about 24 hours total to learn to use and create a prototype using any library we wanted.

We chose ReactJS since it has gained a lot in popularity this last months.

We were only graded based on the Javascript part and we had a very limited time-frame.
Therefore, we decided to create a very redimental backend and database.
Also, we based our code on a [CoreUI](https://coreui.io/react/).

# Testing

Clone this project :

```
git clone https://github.com/BarreiroLindoF/reactive-football
```

Import the .sql file into PhpMyAdmin which can be found in the folder :

```
<project_folder>\database\reactive-football.sql
```

Copy the php files into your www folder which are in the folder :

```
<project_folder>\backend\
```

Open a command line in the folder :

```
<project_folder>\reactive-football
```

Run the command :
(You will need to have Node installed)
```
npm install
```
When all the dependecies have been installed, run the following command:

```
npm start
```
A tab should open in your default browser with the application running.
If it doesn't, you can just type the next address :

```
http://localhost:3000
```
